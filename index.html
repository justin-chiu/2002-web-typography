                    <p><span class="lead-in">A biography of</span> Charlie Parker, inscribed to me in return for a
                        catalogue of a great collection of
                        calligraphy in Chinese painting, was practically the last exchange I had with Jean-Michel
                        Basquiat. On that same occasion, we admired the typographic complexities of Dr. Dee’s mercurial
                        <em>Relation of Some Spirits</em>… and the quixotically haunting images of Athanasius
                        Kircher’s <em>Mundus subterraneus</em>. Word configurations, figures “speaking in tongues,”
                        metascientific images of the unseen (such as the hidden anatomy of the earth’s entrails), the
                        extreme refinements of a 4,000-year-old tradition of writing, as well as the “hieroglyphs” of
                        the late English Renaissance and their philology of magic&mdash;it all seemed to interest
                        Basquiat. This enormous hunger to absorb from the Western and Eastern past (without, however,
                        the least inclination to be himself absorbed) existed alongside Basquiat’s natural immersion in
                        the Afro-American spiritual traditions of voodoo, santeria and candombl&eacute; and in the
                        living mythology of American Pop and its music, particularly the blues and its jazz derivations
                        but also rock, for which he wrote lyrics (his collection of records was immense). A dominant
                        trait, though, among these and other passions and “influences,” even the more specifically
                        artistic ones, was Basquiat’s sense of rebelliousness and freedom, with regard to the central as
                        well as marginal forms and components of our culture. He could use and marvel at anything he
                        thought he could learn from. And, rather unexpectedly, under the guise (or should one say
                        protection?) of a “difficult character,” a disposition both shy and singularly proud, there was
                        a raw receptivity, as if all he came into contact with really touched him, often painfully.</p>
                    <p>It is generally believed that death puts art into perspective, that an artist’s disappearance
                        from the scene of the world allows the world to reach a deeper understanding and a more balanced
                        judgment of his work. Even in this respect the case of Jean-Michel Basquiat may very well prove
                        to be an exception, at least for some time to come. While he was still alive, the conflicting
                        elements of the artist’s persona provided an indispensable, if paradoxical, key to the vital
                        intentions and artistic urgency of his work. But the paintings themselves contain many traces of
                        Basquiat’s deep personal involvement and of his strongest preferences with regard to his elders
                        (Jackson Pollock, Robert Rauschenberg, Cy Twombly and Andy Warhol), providing threads to guide
                        us in exploring and retracing his unique and extraordinary art.</p>

                        to describe Basquiat’s
                        paintings as representational objects. Just when we think we have seized something essential
                        about them, the essence evaporates. The paintings seem to slip away right and left, despite
                        their remarkable compositional strength&mdash;a centripetal tension between all the elements
                        that seems to owe more to a conceptual and poetic toughness than to Basquiat’s obvious gift for
                        formal harmony.</p>
                    <p>Take the triptych <em>Catharsis</em>. It is dominated by the word &ldquo;FORTEZZA&rdquo;
                        (strength) and a big open hand drawn in red in the central panel. A closed left fist on the left
                        panel and the words “LEFT PAW” on the right panel balance each other on a diagonal
                        axis; on the other diagonal, a half-open hand pointing down in the shape of an industrial tool
                        acts as a pendant for two weights labeled &ldquo;250 LBS&rdquo; at either end of a bar resting
                        on one of Basquiat’s topical crowns. Three waves of black paint invade “raw” brown canvases on
                        which graphic and word images traced in various colours dance before our eyes so that none of
                        them can hold our attention for long. The central panel, in a much lighter brown and connected
                        to the right panel by plain, visible hinges, radiates light.</p>

                    <p>This is one of the many paintings by Basquiat in which verbal and graphic anatomical description
                        is prominent. What is absent, though, is the familiar skull/self-portrait, the severed
                        “mannequin head” (which completely takes over another extraordinary canvas, <em>Untitled
                            (Skull)</em>, like a sort of gigantic diorama in an Aztec quartz-crystal <em>calavera</em>).
                        Here, the body is indicated instead by the words &ldquo;LIVER&rdquo; and &ldquo;SPLEEN&rdquo; at
                        the centre, from which vaguely anatomical lines flow down toward a spiral motif (the intestines,
                        perhaps) at the bottom of the panel. Other images figure prominently on the left panel, whose
                        background is predominantly black: an atomic diagram with the word &ldquo;RADIUM&rdquo; written
                        beneath it and partly effaced; a picture “window” with a subway-type graffiti-painted square in
                        its centre, like a picture on the wall that is also effaced (graffiti on graffiti, or graffiti
                        versus graffiti) by jagged lines overflowing into most of the blank portion of the panel. At the
                        bottom, a mauve inset contains an inscription in capital letters that, except for the letter
                        &ldquo;A,&rdquo; have been obliterated by blotches of gold paint. On the right panel, the brown
                        canvas rising conspicuously over the intrusion of blackness is largely taken up by the word
                        &ldquo;ARM&rdquo; and images relating to it; a narrative element creeps in with the enigmatic
                        inscription &ldquo;SUICIDE ATTEMPT&rdquo; over a dotted line marking the wrist.</p>
                    <div class="featured">
                        <p>The paintings seem to slip away right and left, despite their remarkable compositional
                            strength—a
                            centripetal tension between all the elements that seems to owe more to a conceptual and
                            poetic
                            toughness than to Basquiat’s obvious gift for formal harmony.</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>One could go on in greater detail describing the words and images, as well as the placement,
                        colours and shapes, that make it all work as a unified, synthetic message. There is no way to
                        make sense of the sum of all this, nor can it be reduced to any of its parts, for there is no
                        hierarchy to guide us in distinguishing what is central from what is peripheral. With its narrow
                        central panel&mdash;a bleeding hand reaching out in a helpless gesture (&ldquo;IL MANO&rdquo;
                        mistakenly in the masculine gender, perhaps as a way of inserting “noise” between the message
                        and its locution)&mdash;compressed between two wider and more tormented panels, the entire
                        triptych, as an “aesthetic” object, is a masterpiece of balanced visual expression, no less than
                        certain early Henri Matisses, such as <em>The</em> <em>Red Studio</em>, or the large cut-outs he
                        did later. And yet it is also just a fragment in a complex, half-remembered/half-forgotten
                        cosmology, the image and by-product of a world at once whole and hopelessly dismembered.
                        Afro-Brazilian and other “Latin” <em>ex voto</em>&mdash;with their carved-out limbs and body
                        parts offered in exchange for the healing of their “models”&mdash;enact a similar kind of
                        dismembering. But here we almost have a reversal of such popular healing imagery:
                        Basquiat&rsquo;s offerings are actually more like self-immolations, sacrifices of the Self,
                        although more perhaps in the spirit of Comte de Lautr&eacute;amont and Arthur Rimbaud than of
                        Franz Kafka. They do not proceed <em>ex voto</em>, from desire, but from the desert hope, <em>ex
                            desolatione</em>.</p>

                    <p><span class="lead-in">There is a</span> deceptive side to Basquiat’s images. They belong to the
                        honoured American tradition of
                        simplification; they are at once Pop, Minimal and Conceptual. The very early works, rarely seen,
                        attest to these multiple roots.</p>
                    <p>Quite clearly, this is fragmented imagery, imagery that is fragmented from the start. After 100
                        years of aesthetic perception being dismembered in the West, through the decomposition of light
                        and colour, volume and shape, movement and speed, and, finally, through the dissociation of
                        content and referent (as in Surrealism), we had arrived at the American abstract image (seldom
                        truly abstract), in which everything was brought back to the “thing” itself. Rauschenberg showed
                        us that this “thing” was also the image in its casual everyday occurrence (the image on the
                        wall); Jasper Johns “romantically” pointed to the fact that both “paint” and “image” coincided
                        with “painting.” Warhol made the crucial discovery that it was not just the painting of images
                        that had changed, but also the image itself: the image had become a ghostly protagonist, not a
                        made object but a shadow with a life of its own. Paradoxically, the &ldquo;fetish&rdquo; of old
                        had in some way been resuscitated; the given images (<em>images trouv&eacute;es</em>) were now
                        like bodies at once dead and alive&mdash;life-less and yet capturing a life instant.</p>
                    <p>In Basquiat’s figures, this Warholian image of “life back from the dead” (a zombie-like cast
                        transforming the features of the living into instant ancestral commemorations) takes on a
                        distinctly new form, “feeling” and content. Like so many ancient and primitive paintings on rock
                        walls, it becomes both a silhouette and an X-ray. The silhouette of a half-spooky, half-humorous
                        black figure that appeared years ago on many New York walls, particularly at street corners in
                        run-down neighborhoods, was not the work of SAMO, Basquiat’s original street-roaming alter ego,
                        but it might easily have been. Like SAMO’s early public markings and images on canvas, paper and
                        wood, it conveyed a striking sense of isolation (and, of course, loneliness), shamelessly
                        displayed as a defacing so as to append something almost sinister to a vulnerability that became
                        in itself a shield.</p>

                    <p>The blotted silhouettes and transparent “diagrams” of these figures are images by subtraction.
                        One could almost call them <em>images perdues</em>, akin to the <em>cire perdue</em>, or lost
                        wax, of bronze casting. What has been lost here is the <em>body</em> of the image. But what
                        remains is not a <em>mould</em>, as in Marcel Duchamp’s late conception. That was an extreme
                        (and “negative") version of the Platonic notion of the model-idea, in which Duchamp’s nominalism
                        had come full circle, to the formal physicality of form-matter, or form as intrinsically
                        embedded in matter. By reducing both form and matter to signs, Basquiat proceeded not, as
                        Francis Bacon did, to extreme deformation, but to a novel kind of de-formalization. And so these
                        images, in their complex yet utterly simplified fragmentation, form “sets” in which the “values"
                        of the accumulated signs work within the “composition” more by subtraction than by accretion.
                        Along with the twentieth-century idea of neoplastic reduction, there is now a new form of
                        subtraction that is the result of meaning having been materialized even further. The principle
                        is not altogether novel. But what is new is the truly desperate existential rigour with which
                        this frantic adding up so as to take away, so as to remove as much as possible from the
                        structured order of meaning&mdash;"artistic” as well as “ethical” (and political)&mdash;is
                        achieved through the accumulation of images, words and procedures.</p>
                    <div class="featured">
                        <p>Basquiat’s peculiar use of
                            collage, which is quite different from the analytical constructions of the classical
                            avant-garde, reflects this perception-experience of the world that is at once omnivorous and
                            irrevocably distant.</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>In this, too, and it is essential, Basquiat had a way of being central in the marginal, both
                        inside and out. To some extent, of course, this is an eminently American condition. De Kooning
                        said he sometimes felt that “an American artist must feel like a baseball player or
                        something&mdash;a member of a team writing American history.”<span class="note-circle"
                            id="intext-2">&#11044;</span> (Both Basquiat and
                        George Condo have painted “portraits” of the “great America ball player.") We are at the
                        antipodes of <em>Broadway Boogie Woogie</em>, which even Salvador Dal&iacute; grudgingly
                        admired, yet something of that capacity for extremity&mdash;extreme interiority through extreme
                        objectivity&mdash;resurfaces in Basquiat’s flat icons, which are far removed from the age-old
                        issue of figuration versus abstraction. It was once again de Kooning who bluntly stated the
                        problem: “It’s really absurd to make an image, like a human image, with paint today, when you
                        think about it, since we have this problem of doing or not doing. But then all of a sudden it
                        was even more absurd not to do it.”<span class="note-circle" id="intext-5">&#11044;</span> De
                        Kooning, who never painted a “word,” said
                        that he always “liked the word in painting,” the label, the name of the thing, and he also
                        remarked that “one could spend one’s life having this desire to be in and outside at the same
                        time.”<span class="note-circle" id="intext-6">&#11044;</span> But he still related to body
                        space, the space enclosed, as he said, within
                        his own arms wrapped around himself. A flat silhouette, however, is neither in nor out. Like a
                        hieratic icon, it suggests another plane, a different dimension, in which the comic strip
                        borders on the immateriality of the spirit world. The body, constantly evoked, becomes an idea,
                        a fleeting trace without substance, all light and shadow. Like the maker of the image, it is
                        both inside and out.</p>

                        are a form of writing that
                        says “in secret” things that cannot be said openly. Like the physiological functions that are
                        performed in some of those same places, these graffiti are a form of relief: they are an
                        emptying out of accumulated words from which one wants to be unburdened. Their fabulations on
                        sexual and scatological themes belong only superficially to the realm of cryptic communication.
                        Addressed to an Unknown Reader, they are more a way of giving vent to a form of artistic
                        expression ("talk"), and in this they are closer to the solitary satisfactions of masturbation
                        (of which Oscar Wilde once said that it allowed one to keep better company). The curiosity with
                        which one reads these “messages” is in turn voyeuristic; it is like watching somebody engaged in
                        very private acts.</p>
                    <p>Then there are the signs that sprawl over open walls, railroad and subway cars, signs that want
                        to be seen by the greatest possible number of people, signs that aggressively impose themselves
                        on everybody. Yet these too are “hidden” because they are often illegible, cryptic,
                        undecipherable signatures, engrams of a presence without a name, figures only recognizable by
                        “those in the know,” in fact, public gestures stemming from totally suppressed identities, names
                        that <em>cannot</em> be read.</p>

                    <p>But in this new open/cryptic form of graffiti there is something that goes well beyond the
                        traditional scratching of dates and names on walls, monuments and historical and natural sites,
                        or the recording of obscenities in recessed places. Graffiti <em>cover</em> the surface. Open
                        graffiti that spread their signature/signs over any available expanse of plaster, masonry or
                        metal create an added surface, a new skin and a new look for the face of the environment, a sort
                        of mask that hides the identity of the impersonator as it appropriates the urban milieu by
                        wrapping it in its “disguise.” Reality is covered up because reality is perceived as being
                        beyond reach, inaccessible, impossible to control or possess, and governed by rules and
                        principles as remote as those of a distant tribe or empire. The graffiti cover supplants this
                        hard, distant look of things with the rebellious comforts of a radical aesthetic appropriation
                        of a surface one cannot help looking at: the hard surface of (impersonal) things. Graffiti
                        simultaneously take over, cover up and hide both the objectual world and the subject himself.
                    </p>
                    <p>Yet SAMO is something else again. In the intricate, cryptographic, idiosyncratically anonymous
                        and ubiquitous web of multicoloured sprayed “signs,” SAMO not only attests to the existence of a
                        persona, an individual presence (as do the graffiti surreptitiously, beneath its disguise), but
                        also affirms the existence of a personality, an incipient expressive, therefore
                        <em>artistic</em>, personality, irrepressible in that it cannot repress itself. SAMO is the
                        affirmation of an identity that manifests itself both as signature (the artist’s imprint, like
                        the “R. Mutt” on Duchamp’s <em>Fountain</em>) and as self-image, or rather as the image of an
                        iconic self (just as SAMO and &ldquo;R. Mutt&rdquo; are iconic signatures.)</p>

                        &ldquo;self-portraiture” that haunts so much of the most relevant art of our time (Bruce Nauman,
                        William Wegman, Francesco Clemente, Luigi Ontani, Cindy Sherman, Julio Gal&aacute;n)? The stern
                        figure, hair raised and hair-raising, that appears again and again at the centre of a picture or
                        on the side, looking on, is not a caricature (the image of a “character")&mdash;despite its
                        often grotesque features, so unlike the almost angelic beauty of their subject&mdash;nor is it
                        an image “of character.” It is not “realistic,” yet it is very real. It is real in a symbolic
                        way. Its symbolism lies not in what it might stand for but in something intrinsic to the image
                        itself, in its contrasting combination of flat, cartoonlike features and resemblant (as well as
                        humorously self-depreciating) traits. The &ldquo;self&rdquo; that appears again and again like a
                        Jack-in-the-box in so many of Basquiat’s pictures is a sort of animated puppet or
                        mannequin&mdash;the ultimate personalized reincarnation of the “metaphysical” mannequins that
                        populated Giorgio de Chirico’s “bildscapes": personalized yet schematic, an expressionist
                        blueprint, the tracing (and trace) of a person.</p>
                    <p>It is the “leftover” character of the images that once more prevails. There is an appropriation
                        of elements that had been discarded or had lost any organic connection to anything (especially
                        to anything <em>human</em>)&mdash;be it an oil well, or food, or the name of a “hero” (ancient
                        or modern, a warrior, a jazz musician or a ball player). Everything seems irredeemably lost, at
                        the very moment when, finally, absolutely everything is being preserved and becomes accessible
                        to everybody, thus losing all meaning, all belonging, in fact, losing its history. It is this
                        colossal sense of loss at the roots, <em>ab principio</em>, that the Rauschenberg-like
                        accumulation of signs and images in Basquiat’s pictures seems to express.</p>
                    <div class="featured">
                        <p>Reality is covered up because reality is perceived as being beyond reach, inaccessible,
                            impossible to control or possess, and governed by rules and principles as remote as those of
                            a
                            distant tribe or empire.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Graffiti need a &ldquo;wall,&rdquo; and the wall is what American art rediscovered. Rauschenberg,
                        with Twombly and Johns, made it possible once again (perhaps for the last time) to build an art
                        of walls, as in Pompeii. This is an art that does not decorate the wall but recreates it. The
                        wall, this support for picture windows (fake windows, pretending to open onto outer or inner
                        worlds, already dismissed by Duchamp’s <em>Fresh Widow</em>), now <em>becomes</em> the picture.
                        In fact, the wall becomes the piece, and the “piece” is a piece of wall. Hence this American
                        wall is not, after all, like a Roman wall with its marble and fresco covers, a wall that acted
                        as a support for a colourful wrap, a decoration. The Rauschenberg wall that Basquiat partially
                        adopted (through Warhol) and flattened out is “transparent” and structurally totally irrelevant,
                        like the “curtain walls” of American architecture. As such, it is not a wall that one might
                        inscribe or <em>scratch</em> (the word &ldquo;graffiti&rdquo; comes from a verb meaning “to
                        scratch"), despite the importance of words in Rauschenberg&rsquo;s paintings. This wall is only
                        for preexisting imprints, or images of words that have a supporting surface even <em>before</em>
                        they are transposed onto the curtain wall. It is also certainly from Rauschenberg that Basquiat
                        derived his use of “collage,” or rather, one should say, of “pasting on.”</p>
                    <p>In Pompeii, the paintings seem to make a real, sustaining wall an illusion, a rhythmic surface
                        (as Saint Clair Cemin once said). Rauschenberg, by contrast, made up illusions&mdash;complex
                        surfaces that look like walls. We have come full circle, from the falseness of real walls to the
                        reality of false walls. It is to this new wall that the graffiti are grafted, both as image and
                        as word. In the process, the external urban wrapping is brought indoors, and the surface of the
                        city is turned inside out.</p>

                        other
                        painters: basic, primary material. These words are like disconnected images
                        <em>rep&eacute;ch&eacute;es,
                        </em>fragments of our linguistic heritage, isolated and distanced as if they did not really

                        through which the paintings, the words and figures form a new spelling book of the world. There
                        is a
                        small dose of post-Surrealist, post-Conceptual wordplay in all this, but Basquiat’s “found

                        are,
                        for the most part, really<em> found</em>; they are discovered. They seem to belong to a magical
                        view
                        of
                        language in which the physical image of the word, like a spell, can bring things into being and
                        also
                        make them intelligible, can “mean” something and also actually evoke it. In short, it is a sort
                        of
                        depiction, through painting, of language as poetry.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Rauschenberg made “combines” (as he called them)&mdash;object-image constructions in which the
                        object
                        as
                        such invests and rematerializes the image, thus making of the “picture” not a mirror of nature
                        (whether
                        abstract or realistic) but something more like an alternate reality. Basquiat produced
                        unprecedented
                        combinations of words and images (the images themselves, with their schematic quality, are more
                        like
                        language-symbols than pictures) that are actually sign-constructions, which, as representational
                        wholes,
                        acquire the disquieting nature of “speaking-objects.” In this sense, these strange sign-maps are
                        “primitive,” like masks that could perform by themselves, without an impersonator, or like the
                        graphic
                        tableaux of those eighteenth-century masques wherein music, pantomime and words were combined in
                        complex
                        allegorical scenes. The &ldquo;mask&rdquo; aspect points, once more, to the evocation of
                        distance,
                        to a
                        view of humans as saints and heroes, as champions and kings, and as ancestors, whereas the
                        “masque"
                        aspect corresponds to the call of the modern, the roots of that other performative distance from
                        ourselves and from what we are, which we are bound to maintain.</p>
                    <p>The visible stretchers on Basquiat’s canvases (as in <em>Both Poles</em>) are in a way the
                        opposite
                        of
                        frames; they are a way of de-framing the already unframed picture-object. Other rough devices,
                        such
                        as
                        the hinges on <em>Catharsis</em>, also stress the work’s character as a receptacle of signs.
                        This is
                        something&mdash;by Basquiat’s implicit admission&mdash;that would not have been possible without
                        the
                        precedent of Rauschenberg’s vertiginously innovative and wholly American “na&iuml;vet&eacute;”
                        (the
                        word
                        is Johns’s). It is also something (to echo Georg Simmel) that brought painting a step further
                        away
                        from
                        “fine arts” and perhaps many steps closer to the actual realization of “pure” art-action (or, if
                        one
                        prefers, art-will)&mdash;the ultimate identification of art and life that has been the great
                        aspiration
                        of the West since the Romantic revolution. This may also be the moment at which the making of
                        art-objects reaches its point of dissolution, the very limits of its raison d’&ecirc;tre.</p>

                    <p>Basquiat’s resolutely “artistic” meta-graffiti, his deliberate and artificial transpositions of
                        “primary,” ostensibly unschooled graphic gestures into an idiosyncratic and strongly defined
                        formal
                        idiom, also represent a further expansion of the boundaries of “art” and, conversely, the
                        bringing
                        to
                        bear on art of the first radically new “aesthetic” gesture since Pollock’s: a sort of Action
                        painting
                        whose starting elements are clusters of primary images and word images right off the brush
                        rather
                        than
                        drips of primary colour right out of the can. This carefully cultivated spontaneity (as in some
                        of
                        the
                        musical and verbal compositions of John Cage) of a “primitivism” variously orchestrated through
                        recurring but only apparently redundant themes and variations, strongly contributes to keeping
                        most
                        of
                        Basquiat’s paintings on a tensely vibrating key, like the impossibly protracted high note of a
                        jazz
                        trumpet. Looking at them when they were first painted, one might have wondered which would break
                        first,
                        the music or the player. Pollock’s and Basquiat’s “accidental” deaths were, in that sense, not
                        just
                        a
                        coincidence.</p>
                    <p>Basquiat is not the only artist who has made the copyright symbol a significant recurring element
                        in
                        his
                        work. Conceptual artists of various sorts have often used it. This coincidence stems from an
                        “objective"
                        condition by which industrial objects, and hence industrially produced and mechanically
                        reproduced
                        images, have taken over greater and greater areas of the visible, being, as they are, at the
                        same
                        time
                        made by no one and someone&rsquo;s property, for the most part already owned and already spent.
                        Even
                        Rauschenberg recently lamented that “everything is copyrighted.” One has the impression that for
                        Basquiat the symbol was first of all a ubiquitous hidden feature of the natural/unnatural urban
                        environment that is reflected in his imagery. The obsessive recurrence of certain associations
                        of
                        the
                        copyright sign with certain images, and especially with certain words and verbal expressions
                        (verbal
                        images, as I see them), indicates a specific and pointed “message.” It seems that although the
                        images
                        themselves have lost meaning and the meaning of words must be reinvented (or at least
                        rediscovered),
                        poetic expression has found refuge in the ironic traces of <em>cool</em> nostalgic
                        “appropriations."
                        There is no picking and choosing, nor is it a question of sentiments. As Rauschenberg testified,
                        “Feelings don’t make for good art, necessarily; you can make good art totally without feelings
                        quicker
                        than you can make any art based on feelings.”<span class="note-circle"

                        consciousness, but Basquiat invested it with the fire of his great capacity for both
                        participation
                        and
                        remoteness: inherent marginality chosen as the only possible starting point&mdash;in the end
                        with
                        tragic
                        consequences, as we know&mdash;in order to maintain the distance that transforms the object of
                        representation into a poetic object. Basquiat’s copyright sign, removing his images still
                        further
                        from
                        their maker through that same gesture of mock appropriation that is apparently indicated, has
                        all
                        the
                        paradoxical character of a symbol, pointing simultaneously to identification and to its
                        impossibility.
                        &ldquo;Nothing worth copying,&rdquo; he seems to be saying, but also, &ldquo;[My] poetry

                    <p>Actually, one might interpret the words and phrases in Basquiat’s paintings as Yasushi Inoue
                        described
                        his own poetic notes: “They are not so much poetry as small boxes in which poetry is locked
                        up….
                        If
                        some magic spell were cast upon them, real poems would emerge.” Inoue goes on to say, modestly
                        and
                        rather unjustly, that he is “a poet who has never succeeded in discovering the
                        spell.”<span class="note-circle" id="intext-10">&#11044;</span>
                        Basquiat’s words on canvas exert a spell on us <em>as if</em> they were poetry pent up inside
                        vibrating
                        boxes, like the tiny, black, eerily buzzing box a burly Asian patron, in Luis Bu&ntilde;uel’s
                        <em>Belle
                            de jour</em>, produces for the heroine as an erotic prop. But they are also like revealed
                        mysteries,
                        or, better yet, “suspicions” of poetry (Ren&eacute; Ricard wrote that there are no unsolved
                        mysteries,
                        only suspicions), emerging from our ever more chaotic forests of language, images and history.
                        There
                        is
                        a sort of innocent, joyful perversity that once more is wholly American: “O God&mdash;Only

                        could

                        echoing &Eacute;douard Manet’s
                        famous
                        dictum that art “should be discouraged.” Certainly Basquiat could not avoid being an artist, but
                        the
                        striking “innocence” of his artistic personality was in some way opposite to Rauschenberg’s
                        “innocence
                        you have to nourish every day.” And every day Basquiat worked at “undoing” and negating his
                        natural
                        innocence, that touch of grace by which he appeared to glide through everything unscathed. But
                        because
                        he failed always to shed its aura, he actually strengthened and reaffirmed that innocence. Black
                        and
                        like a Jack Kerouac of painting, he was a true American artist-hero.</p>
                    <p>Jean-Michel Basquiat is also, in a more general sense, one of the truly original Western artists
                        of
                        the
                        1980s. His paintings show, in retrospect, the necessity and the inevitability of all significant
                        contributions to our poetic understanding of the world. What Basquiat did, in such a short time,
                        already
                        belongs to the history of Western art. To underestimate this fact and to fail to recognize that
                        it
                        is in
                        some way independent of his origins and the circumstances of his death would be a grave
                        misrepresentation. Yet in considering Basquiat’s place in our artistic landscape we must also
                        take
                        into
                        account the place whence he came, the roots of his problematic identity and the original
                        configuration
                        of his tormented and tormenting spirit. The question is a delicate one: it is difficult to
                        identify
                        some
                        of these points of origin without somehow implying a “minor mode"&mdash;a sort of artistic
                        ghetto&mdash;that the artist had proceeded from and belonged to. It will be important, some day,
                        to
                        define in precisely what sense a kind of marginality and a “marginal” stance are essential
                        components of
                        Basquiat’s background and his expressive makeup.</p>

                    <p>It was at a Ray Charles concert in the gigantic Houston Astrodome, almost twenty years ago, that
                        I
                        was
                        first struck by the existence of a diffuse and distinctive black American visual aesthetic,
                        which is
                        not
                        as apparent in the urban settings of the Northeast. Practically all the men there, and many of
                        the
                        women
                        too, were dressed in custom-made clothes. The materials themselves&mdash;not to mention the
                        combinations&mdash;looked as if they had been woven expressly for each particular outfit. I
                        don’t
                        know
                        that I ever witnessed a more astounding display of the affirmation of individual originality
                        within
                        a
                        common cultural idiom. It had something of the extravagance and modish refinement one imagines
                        to
                        have
                        existed at the court of Versailles in the eighteenth century. Some of that same “Southern"
                        phantasmagoria can also be found in many of Basquiat’s canvases and works on paper. Yet despite
                        the
                        “wildness” of the imagery this aspect is not dominant, partly on account of the extraordinary
                        instinct
                        by which Basquiat’s colours and shapes always seem to balance each other in what invariably
                        becomes
                        a
                        very <em>savant</em> composition.<span class="note-circle" id="intext-13">&#11044;</span></p>

                        <p class="source-ref">I recall visiting this studio in 1984 or so and seeing a large work with
                            rather complex imagery dominated by a variation of his recurring, haunting black head. When
                            I
                            returned, two days later, with the chairman of a museum collection, the picture had changed
                            completely: most of the original graphic complexity had been obliterated by large patches of
                            dark colour, yet the composition was still very strong. It would have been difficult to
                            choose
                            between the two versions if they had been painted side by side, rather than one on top of
                            the
                            other. Rauschenberg, to the horror of Betty Parsons, had a similarly free attitude toward
                            many
                            of his "finished" paintings.</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>It is not clear how much actual Haitian and Puerto Rican culture Jean-Michel Basquiat was able to
                        absorb
                        in his early youth, but it is apparent from the work, just as it was explicit in the man, that
                        he
                        strongly identified with his black roots. His successful connection with the “mainstream” of
                        Western
                        art, though it certainly caused him extremely complex and, in an American context, perhaps
                        insurmountable existential and psychological problems, in no way severed him from the primary
                        cultural
                        and ethnic sources of his experiences. I have mentioned the homage to both Abstract
                        Expressionism
                        and
                        Pop art that is implicit in the extraordinary formal mastery Basquiat was able to achieve at a
                        fantastically early age.<span class="note-circle" id="intext-14">&#11044;</span> His use of
                        words, however, belongs more to the <em>oral
                        </em>traditions of Afro-American cultures&mdash;the ecstatic invocations of Voodoo worshippers;
                        the
                        inflamed and inflaming spiritual rhetoric of Baptist preachers with their rousing, recurring,
                        rhythmic
                        juxtapositions of ethical, cosmological and practical tenets; and, of course, now, black
                        rap&mdash;than
                        to the sophisticated nominalist games of avant-garde art, from Duchamp to Johns and Warhol, from
                        Marcel
                        Broodthaers to Joseph Kosuth, and many others. In Basquiat’s paintings words have a
                        “concreteness"
                        that
                        seems immune to trendy semiological games. Russian avant-garde artists had also touched on that
                        quality
                        once, but the concreteness of their painted words was a sort of formal materialism. Basquiat’s
                        concepts
                        and verbal images are presented as poetic but essentially non-written discoveries. Or rather,
                        they
                        are
                        evocations, epiphanies of words whose written form is used as a visual discovery of an oral
                        content.
                        Instead of the separation between the written and the oral that exists in Duchamp’s puns, in
                        Basquiat’s
                        work there is a sort of newfound conjunction between the word and its concrete or ideal
                        referent; it
                        is
                        a <em>gestural</em> conjunction, not a logical/semantic one, and as such, once more, it owes a
                        debt
                        to
                        Pollock. I see this performative aspect of language in Basquiat’s painting as a strikingly
                        “black"
                        component of his art, and this is perhaps what allowed Afro-American culture&mdash;at a time
                        when
                        American art was finally receptive to it, and even <em>needed</em> it&mdash;to make a crucial
                        and
                        indelible contribution to Western painting.</p>

                            Frank Stella’s comparable precociousness, twenty years earlier, had been just as
                            exceptional,
                            but whereas Stella’s connections were mostly with the Mark Rothko-Barnett Newman dimension
                            of
                            Abstract Expressionism, in Basquiat’s work one finds traces of almost all the greater
                            painters
                            of the previous two generations, though he cannot be termed a follower of any of them.

                            Yet in considering Basquiat’s place in our artistic landscape we must also take into account
                            the
                            place whence he came, the roots of his problematic identity and the original configuration
                            of
                            his tormented and tormenting spirit.

                    <p>Basquiat <em>knew </em>in his veins, in his blood, in all of his being, that for black culture to
                        survive
                        at this stage&mdash;in America, but ultimately also in the world at large&mdash;it had to manage
                        neither
                        to be assimilated by nor to assimilate white culture (as was once considered desirable). The
                        secret
                        was
                        not to resist white culture in order to preserve the purity of its own heritage (as had been
                        first
                        necessary, then fashionable) but to both comprehend and transcend white culture by learning and
                        appropriating both its achievements (its <em>crowning</em>, in Basquiat&rsquo;s imagery) and its
                        disintegration (its dismembered skeletons&mdash;in and out of closets).</p>
                    <p>Jean-Michel Basquiat was, in that sense, an innovator: he summed up the work of two whole (white)
                        artistic generations while introducing a racially and culturally “marginal” blackness into the
                        “mainstream” of Western art. It was in the precarious balance between being the latest important
                        representative of a great white tradition and the first to make a significant black contribution
                        to
                        it,
                        in this tension between an end and a beginning, that Jean-Michel Basquiat conducted his meteoric
                        career.
                        There are indications that he was conscious of the tragic impossibility of his position. And
                        that,
                        together with the love and envy of the gods, may be why he had to leave us so soon.</p>
